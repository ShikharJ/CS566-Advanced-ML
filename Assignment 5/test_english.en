a black box in your car
as americas road planners struggle to find the cash to mend a crumbling highway system many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that fits neatly by the dashboard of your car
the devices which track every mile a motorist drives and transmit that information to bureaucrats are at the center of a controversial attempt in washington and state planning offices to overhaul the outdated system for funding americas major roads
the usually dull arena of highway planning has suddenly spawned intense debate and colorful alliances
libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive and possibly where you drive them then use the information to draw up a tax bill
the tea party is aghast
the american civil liberties union is deeply concerned too raising a variety of privacy issues
and while congress cant agree on whether to proceed several states are not waiting
they are exploring how over the next decade they can move to a system in which drivers pay per mile of road they roll over
thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes some of which have gps monitoring for a test drive
this really is a must for our nation
it is not a matter of something we might choose to do said hasan ikhrata executive director of the southern california assn of governments which is planning for the state to start tracking miles driven by every california motorist by
there is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes
the technology is there to do it
the push comes as the countrys highway trust fund financed with taxes americans pay at the gas pump is broke
americans dont buy as much gas as they used to
cars get many more miles to the gallon
the federal tax itself cents per gallon hasnt gone up in years
politicians are loath to raise the tax even one penny when gas prices are high
the gas tax is just not sustainable said lee munnich a transportation policy expert at the university of minnesota
his state recently put tracking devices on cars to test out a pay by mile system
this works out as the most logical alternative over the long term he said
wonks call it a mileage based user fee
it is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liberals as the taxes could be rigged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce congestion and greenhouse gases for example
california planners are looking to the system as they devise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the states ambitious global warming laws
but rep bill shuster r pa chairman of the house transportation committee has said he too sees it as the most viable long term alternative
the free marketeers at the reason foundation are also fond of having drivers pay per mile
this is not just a tax going into a black hole said adrian moore vice president of policy at reason
people are paying more directly into what they are getting
the movement is also bolstered by two former us transportation secretaries who in a report urged congress to move in the pay per mile direction
the us senate approved a million pilot project last year that would have involved about cars
but the house leadership killed the proposal acting on concerns of rural lawmakers representing constituents whose daily lives often involve logging lots of miles to get to work or into town
several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own
the most eager is oregon which is enlisting drivers in the countrys biggest experiment
those drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of gas taxes to the state
nevada has already completed a pilot
new york city is looking into one
illinois is trying it on a limited basis with trucks
and the i coalition which includes state transportation departments along the eastern seaboard including maryland pennsylvania virginia and florida is studying how they could go about implementing the change
the concept is not a universal hit
in nevada where about volunteers cars were equipped with the devices not long ago drivers were uneasy about the government being able to monitor their every move
concerns about big brother and those sorts of things were a major problem said alauddin khan who directs strategic and performance management at the nevada department of transportation
it was not something people wanted
as the trial got underway the aclu of nevada warned on its website it would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full fledged tracking devices
there is no need to build an enormous unwieldy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals everyday comings and goings
nevada is among several states now scrambling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven but not exactly where and at what time
if you can do that khan said the public gets more comfortable
the hunt for that technology has led some state agencies to a small california startup called true mileage
the firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers
it was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance in which drivers would pay based on their mileage
but the devices it is testing appeal to highway planners because they dont use gps and deliver a limited amount of information uploaded periodically by modem
people will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location said ryan morrison chief executive of true mileage
there have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs
there are a lot less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this
in oregon planners are experimenting with giving drivers different choices
they can choose a device with or without gps
or they can choose not to have a device at all opting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents
other places are hoping to sell the concept to a wary public by having the devices do more not less
in new york city transportation officials are seeking to develop a taxing device that would also be equipped to pay parking meter fees provide pay as you drive insurance and create a pool of real time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic
motorists would be attracted to participate because of the value of the benefits it offers to them says a city planning document
some transportation planners though wonder if all the talk about paying by the mile is just a giant distraction
at the metropolitan transportation commission in the san francisco bay area officials say congress could very simply deal with the bankrupt highway trust fund by raising gas taxes
an extra one time or annual levy could be imposed on drivers of hybrids and others whose vehicles dont use much gas so they pay their fair share
there is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an aspirin said randy rentschler the commissions director of legislation and public affairs
if we do this hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a host of other things
